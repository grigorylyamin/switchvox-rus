Each Phonebook entry is based on one main extension or phone number, but it can
have also have additional numbers associated with it. This way, you can have one
Phonebook entry for a person, and have all of their contact numbers included in
that entry. The Additional Numbers are available via a drop down menu in the
Switchboard Phonebook panel.
<br/><br/>
Additional Numbers can be entered by an extension owner, or you can enter them
in your Phonebook entry. 
<br/><br/>
Additional Numbers entered by an extension owner are available when you add the
extension to your Phonebook. These numbers appear as locked (<img src="/images/common/lock_small.gif"/>) and cannot be
edited, however you can choose to hide them.
<br/><br/>
Additional numbers that you add to your Phonebook entry can be edited and
deleted. You can also copy any Additional Numbers (including the owner\'s
numbers), and then edit and delete the copy.
